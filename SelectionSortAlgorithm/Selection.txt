📌 How Selection Sort Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Find the smallest element in the unsorted array.
2️⃣ Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
3️⃣ Move to the next position and repeat the process until the array is sorted.

 Step-by-Step Breakdown of Selection Sort
Let's go step by step to understand how Selection Sort works using an example.

Example Array: [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]
We will sort this array in ascending order using Selection Sort.

Step 1️⃣: Find the Minimum in the Unsorted Array
👉 The first element (5) is assumed to be the smallest.
👉 Compare 5 with all elements in the right (3, 8, 1, 2).
✅ Smallest is 1, so swap it with 5.
🔹 Array after Pass 1: [1, 3, 8, 5, 2]

Step 2️⃣: Find the Next Minimum in the Remaining Unsorted Part
👉 Now, look at the remaining unsorted part: [3, 8, 5, 2].
👉 Assume 3 is the smallest and compare it with 8, 5, 2.
✅ Smallest is 2, so swap it with 3.
🔹 Array after Pass 2: [1, 2, 8, 5, 3]

Step 3️⃣: Find the Next Minimum in the Remaining Unsorted Part
👉 Look at the remaining unsorted part: [8, 5, 3].
👉 Assume 8 is the smallest and compare it with 5, 3.
✅ Smallest is 3, so swap it with 8.
🔹 Array after Pass 3: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Step 4️⃣: Find the Minimum in the Last Two Elements
👉 Look at [5, 8].
✅ Smallest is 5, and it's already in place, so no swap needed.
🔹 Array after Pass 4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

✅ Array is fully sorted! 🎉
