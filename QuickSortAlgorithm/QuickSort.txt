ðŸ”¹ What is Quick Sort?
Divide and Conquer algorithm.
Selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around it.
Elements less than the pivot go to the left.
Elements greater than the pivot go to the right.
Recursively applies the same process to subarrays.


ðŸ”¹ How Does It Work?
Choose a Pivot: Usually, the last element is chosen as the pivot.
Partitioning:
Place all elements smaller than the pivot to the left.
Place all elements greater than the pivot to the right.
Pivot is now in its final sorted position.
Recursively apply Quick Sort to left and right subarrays.
Base Case: Arrays of length 0 or 1 are already sorted.
